  abstract = {Computers are physical systems: what they can and cannot do is dictated
	by the laws of physics. In particular, the speed with which a physical
	device can process information is limited by its energy and the amount
	of information that it can process is limited by the number of degrees
	of freedom it possesses. This paper explores the physical limits
	of computation as determined by the speed of light $c$, the quantum
	scale $\hbar$ and the gravitational constant $G$. As an example,
	quantitative bounds are put to the computational power of an `ultimate
	laptop' with a mass of one kilogram confined to a volume of one liter.},
